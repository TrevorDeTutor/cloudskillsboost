## Set Up and Configure a Cloud Environment in Google Cloud: Challenge Lab

### Challenge Scenario:
As a cloud engineer in Jooli Inc. and recently trained with Google Cloud and Kubernetes you have been asked to help a new team (Griffin) set up their environment. The team has asked for your help and has done some work, but needs you to complete the work.

### You need to complete the following tasks:

1. Create a development VPC with three subnets manually

2. Create a production VPC with three subnets manually

3. Create a bastion that is connected to both VPCs

4. Create a development Cloud SQL Instance and connect and prepare the WordPress environment

5. Create a Kubernetes cluster in the development VPC for WordPress

6. Prepare the Kubernetes cluster for the WordPress environment

7. Create a WordPress deployment using the supplied configuration

8. Enable monitoring of the cluster via stackdriver

9. Provide access for an additional engineer

### Standards you should follow:

- Create all resources in the us-east1 region and us-east1-b zone, unless otherwise directed.

- Use the project VPCs.

- Naming is normally team-resource, e.g. an instance could be named kraken-webserver1.

- Allocate cost effective resource sizes.
